        "  Barbara: @JC: A great option is tissue paper. It takes up less space and is easier to reuse, especially if you're moving to a new stop every few days. Plus, it’s easy to buy more if you need to replace or supplement it.\n",
        "  Jo: @JC: My mother traveled extensively for business in the days of formal suits and heels. She used both dry cleaning bags and tissue. The tissue prevents creases, and the cleaner bags help clothes slide without bunching. If you don’t have a dry cleaner bag, you can use a clean tall kitchen garbage bag.\n",
        "  Russell C.: @BayArea101: 24 days, 22 stops, 15 countries? That sounds like an illustration by exaggeration—otherwise, I can’t imagine a more absurd itinerary!\n",
        "  Sara: @JC: Not to mention the waste. Why do dry cleaners still use these wasteful bags and hangers?\n",
        "  Dee: @Jo: I used to travel for work to remote places. I carried dry cleaner fl uid and a steamer for spot cleaning and touch-ups.\n",
        "  Mike M: @Russell C.: I had itineraries like that during my 17 years of international travel. One trip involved a 7-day loop from the US to Europe, Asia, Australia, and back, with two nights on planes. Road warriors indeed!\n",
        "  ewc: @BayArea101: ‘Decades-old’—is there anything in the article that\n",

        "  Bridgman (Original Commenter):I recently checked a suitcase for the fi rst time in years and guess what? I'm here to stay. Though no match for the euphoria of a seat upgrade, not being one of the hordes desperately stuffi ng their over-the-limit bags into overheads was delightful. I took out a good book and read. The fact is, I also have arthritis and can't do it anyway, so no more will I be the pathetic one depending on the kindness (or ire) of other passengers. Not only is the extra cost worth it, I have everything I need which, while not a lot, gives comfort and peace.\n",
        "  B.R.: @Bridgman: It's never the cost that gets me but the real fear my luggage missed the connection. Nope, even with an air tag, I don't want to start my vacation without my luggage.\n",
        "  BJ: @B.R.: Use a backpack for a personal item, adding a change of underwear and shirt/top. You'll be ready just in case. A friend also suggested using an airtag or tile packed in the suitcase in case it's lost.\n",
        "  jk: @BJ: Yes, that holds you over for a day or so, but sometimes your luggage doesn't reach you for a week. Plus, you don't have anything nice to wear for the fi rst couple of days. What if you're sightseeing and don't have the right outfi t, walking shoes, or comfortable clothing?\n",
        "  BJ: @jk: I always wear my walking shoes to fl y. Airports are large, and they’re the bulkiest shoes I bring. Likewise, a foldable hat, medication, and toiletries should go in the personal item. Only once has my bag been misdirected in 60 years of fl ying.\n",
        "  mdieri: @Bridgman: Noblesse oblige? It’s nice to fl y unburdened, but you risk your luggage not arriving or arriving damaged. Last time I checked my rollaboard, I waited 45 minutes at baggage claim. Airlines should offer the fi rst checked bag free, but they’re too greedy.\n",
        "  Louise: @mdieri: Have you heard about Southwest Airlines? Two checked bags for free is standard policy. However, they’ve gone big on offering seating upgrades like Early Bird, which used to be cheaper. But for international travel, Southwest has limited routes.\n",
        "  Winnie: @mdieri: I worry more about hurting my back from hefting a bag into the overhead than I do about bag damage or loss. Happy travels!\n",
        "  Lc: @Bridgman: I'm the opposite. I never check a bag and can waltz off the plane and start my vacation without worrying about lost or delayed luggage. I have the right size bag, so I’m never desperately stuffi ng anything. I’ll never check a bag again!\n",
        "  Mimi: @Bridgman: If you have connecting fl ights, it only takes one miss and lost luggage to change your mind!\n",
        "  Kat: @B.R.: I'm with you! Friends had their luggage lost in Berlin, and it didn’t catch up with them for a week. That was a nightmare for them. Bridgman, count yourself lucky that your bag was waiting for you at your destination.\n",
        "  Kat: @jk: Good points! I have no choice but to check a bag when doing summer mission work in Europe, but I make sure my carry-on can tide me over for a couple of days, including footwear. Friends lost their bags in Berlin for a whole week.\n",
        "  Joel Lafl eur: @Bridgman: I had to check a bag for the fi rst time in 20 years because my wife's rollaboard wouldn’t fi t in a tiny regional jet. We wasted 30 minutes at baggage claim and missed our connecting bus. Never again.\n",
        "  Benita Auge: @Bridgman: For years, I took carry-ons onto the plane, but last year I started checking them. So far, the airline has lost it twice, and one was ripped open by handlers. I’m going back to keeping my carry-on with me.\n",

This is a decades-old solution that, surprisingly enough, continues to work to this day. When you're a road warrior on a 24-day, 22-stop trip to 15 countries, you've got to up your game or you'll look like an incompetent within days of setting out. Worse, you'll feel like one.\n",

You can also add a layer of protection from wrinkles by putting skirts and blouses in plastic dry cleaning bags before folding them fl at and then placing them at the top of your bag.\"\n",
        "  JC: @BayArea101: The article mentions the dry cleaners bag trick. But my question is—what else could be used? Many people don’t dry clean their clothes, so they don't have the bags.\n",

        "  Jo: @JC: My mother traveled extensively for business in the days of formal suits and heels. She used both dry cleaning bags and tissue. The tissue prevents creases, and the cleaner bags help clothes slide without bunching. If you don’t have a dry cleaner bag, you can use a clean tall kitchen garbage bag.\n",
        "  Russell C.: @BayArea101: 24 days, 22 stops, 15 countries? That sounds like an illustration by exaggeration—otherwise, I can’t imagine a more absurd itinerary!\n",
        "  Sara: @JC: Not to mention the waste. Why do dry cleaners still use these wasteful bags and hangers?\n",

        "  Bridgman (Original Commenter):I recently checked a suitcase for the fi rst time in years and guess what? I'm here to stay. Though no match for the euphoria of a seat upgrade, not being one of the hordes desperately stuffi ng their over-the-limit bags into overheads was delightful. I took out a good book and read. The fact is, I also have arthritis and can't do it anyway, so no more will I be the pathetic one depending on the kindness (or ire) of other passengers. Not only is the extra cost worth it, I have everything I need which, while not a lot, gives comfort and peace.\n",
        "  B.R.: @Bridgman: It's never the cost that gets me but the real fear my luggage missed the connection. Nope, even with an air tag, I don't want to start my vacation without my luggage.\n",
        "  BJ: @B.R.: Use a backpack for a personal item, adding a change of underwear and shirt/top. You'll be ready just in case. A friend also suggested using an airtag or tile packed in the suitcase in case it's lost.\n",
        "  jk: @BJ: Yes, that holds you over for a day or so, but sometimes your luggage doesn't reach you for a week. Plus, you don't have anything nice to wear for the fi rst couple of days. What if you're sightseeing and don't have the right outfi t, walking shoes, or comfortable clothing?\n",
        "  BJ: @jk: I always wear my walking shoes to fl y. Airports are large, and they’re the bulkiest shoes I bring. Likewise, a foldable hat, medication, and toiletries should go in the personal item. Only once has my bag been misdirected in 60 years of fl ying.\n",
        "  mdieri: @Bridgman: Noblesse oblige? It’s nice to fl y unburdened, but you risk your luggage not arriving or arriving damaged. Last time I checked my rollaboard, I waited 45 minutes at baggage claim. Airlines should offer the fi rst checked bag free, but they’re too greedy.\n",
        "  Louise: @mdieri: Have you heard about Southwest Airlines? Two checked bags for free is standard policy. However, they’ve gone big on offering seating upgrades like Early Bird, which used to be cheaper. But for international travel, Southwest has limited routes.\n",
        "  Winnie: @mdieri: I worry more about hurting my back from hefting a bag into the overhead than I do about bag damage or loss. Happy travels!\n",
        "  Lc: @Bridgman: I'm the opposite. I never check a bag and can waltz off the plane and start my vacation without worrying about lost or delayed luggage. I have the right size bag, so I’m never desperately stuffi ng anything. I’ll never check a bag again!\n",
        "  Mimi: @Bridgman: If you have connecting fl ights, it only takes one miss and lost luggage to change your mind!\n",
        "  Kat: @B.R.: I'm with you! Friends had their luggage lost in Berlin, and it didn’t catch up with them for a week. That was a nightmare for them. Bridgman, count yourself lucky that your bag was waiting for you at your destination.\n",
        "  Kat: @jk: Good points! I have no choice but to check a bag when doing summer mission work in Europe, but I make sure my carry-on can tide me over for a couple of days, including footwear. Friends lost their bags in Berlin for a whole week.\n",
        "  Joel Lafl eur: @Bridgman: I had to check a bag for the fi rst time in 20 years because my wife's rollaboard wouldn’t fi t in a tiny regional jet. We wasted 30 minutes at baggage claim and missed our connecting bus. Never again.\n",
        "  Benita Auge: @Bridgman: For years, I took carry-ons onto the plane, but last year I started checking them. So far, the airline has lost it twice, and one was ripped open by handlers. I’m going back to keeping my carry-on with me.\n",

        "    BayArea101 (Original Commenter): Don't want wrinkles? Fold (or whatever) with dry cleaning bags between each layer. This is a decades-old solution that, surprisingly enough, continues to work to this day. When you're a road warrior on a 24-day, 22-stop trip to 15 countries, you've got to up your game or you'll look like an incompetent within days of setting out. Worse, you'll feel like one.\n",
        "    Marissa: @BayArea101: You must have missed that the article already contained this tip, \"Clothing should go toward the top of your bag to reduce creases created from weight, with jackets going in last. You can also add a layer of protection from wrinkles by putting skirts and blouses in plastic dry cleaning bags before folding them fl at and then placing them at the top of your bag.\"\n",
        "    JC: @BayArea101: The article mentions the dry cleaners bag trick. But my question is—what else could be used? Many people don’t dry clean their clothes, so they don't have the bags.\n",
        "    Barbara: @JC: A great option is tissue paper. It takes up less space and is easier to reuse, especially if you're moving to a new stop every few days. Plus, it’s easy to buy more if you need to replace or supplement it.\n",
        "    Jo: @JC: My mother traveled extensively for business in the days of formal suits and heels. She used both dry cleaning bags and tissue. The tissue prevents creases, and the cleaner bags help clothes slide without bunching. If you don’t have a dry cleaner bag, you can use a clean tall kitchen garbage bag.\n",
        "    Russell C.: @BayArea101: 24 days, 22 stops, 15 countries? That sounds like an illustration by exaggeration—otherwise, I can’t imagine a more absurd itinerary!\n",
        "    Sara: @JC: Not to mention the waste. Why do dry cleaners still use these wasteful bags and hangers?\n",
        "    Dee: @Jo: I used to travel for work to remote places. I carried dry cleaner fl uid and a steamer for spot cleaning and touch-ups.\n",
        "    Mike M: @Russell C.: I had itineraries like that during my 17 years of international travel. One trip involved a 7-day loop from the US to Europe, Asia, Australia, and back, with two nights on planes. Road warriors indeed!\n",
        "    ewc: @BayArea101: ‘Decades-old’—is there anything in the article that\n",
        "    isn’t? Does anyone still use 2-wheeled suitcases?\n",
        "    Yvette: @Sara: The bags keep our clothes neat and tidy after dry cleaning until we get home. Simple as that.\n",

Though no match for the euphoria of a seat upgrade, not being one of the hordes desperately stuffing their over-the-limit bags into overheads was delightful. I took out a good book and read. The fact is, I also have arthritis and can't do it anyway, so no more will I be the pathetic one depending on the kindness (or ire) of other passengers. Not only is the extra cost worth it, I have everything I need which, while not a lot, gives comfort and peace.\"\n",

        "    BayArea101 (Original Commenter): Don't want wrinkles? Fold (or whatever) with dry cleaning bags between each layer. This is a decades-old solution that, surprisingly enough, continues to work to this day. When you're a road warrior on a 24-day, 22-stop trip to 15 countries, you've got to up your game or you'll look like an incompetent within days of setting out. Worse, you'll feel like one.\n",
        "    Marissa: @BayArea101: You must have missed that the article already contained this tip, \"Clothing should go toward the top of your bag to reduce creases created from weight, with jackets going in last. You can also add a layer of protection from wrinkles by putting skirts and blouses in plastic dry cleaning bags before folding them fl at and then placing them at the top of your bag.\"\n",
        "    JC: @BayArea101: The article mentions the dry cleaners bag trick. But my question is—what else could be used? Many people don’t dry clean their clothes, so they don't have the bags.\n",
        "    Barbara: @JC: A great option is tissue paper. It takes up less space and is easier to reuse, especially if you're moving to a new stop every few days. Plus, it’s easy to buy more if you need to replace or supplement it.\n",
        "    Jo: @JC: My mother traveled extensively for business in the days of formal suits and heels. She used both dry cleaning bags and tissue. The tissue prevents creases, and the cleaner bags help clothes slide without bunching. If you don’t have a dry cleaner bag, you can use a clean tall kitchen garbage bag.\n",
        "    Russell C.: @BayArea101: 24 days, 22 stops, 15 countries? That sounds like an illustration by exaggeration—otherwise, I can’t imagine a more absurd itinerary!\n",
        "    Sara: @JC: Not to mention the waste. Why do dry cleaners still use these wasteful bags and hangers?\n",
        "    Dee: @Jo: I used to travel for work to remote places. I carried dry cleaner fl uid and a steamer for spot cleaning and touch-ups.\n",
        "    Mike M: @Russell C.: I had itineraries like that during my 17 years of international travel. One trip involved a 7-day loop from the US to Europe, Asia, Australia, and back, with two nights on planes. Road warriors indeed!\n",
        "    ewc: @BayArea101: ‘Decades-old’—is there anything in the article that\n",
        "    isn’t? Does anyone still use 2-wheeled suitcases?\n",
        "    Yvette: @Sara: The bags keep our clothes neat and tidy after dry cleaning until we get home. Simple as that.\n",
        "    Yvette:@Russell C.: Maybe that type of job just isn’t for you.\n",

        "    - Bridgman (Original Commenter): \"I recently checked a suitcase for the first time in years and guess what? I'm here to stay. Though no match for the euphoria of a seat upgrade, not being one of the hordes desperately stuffing their over-the-limit bags into overheads was delightful. I took out a good book and read. The fact is, I also have arthritis and can't do it anyway, so no more will I be the pathetic one depending on the kindness (or ire) of other passengers. Not only is the extra cost worth it, I have everything I need which, while not a lot, gives comfort and peace.\"\n",
        "    - B.R.: \"@Bridgman: It's never the cost that gets me but the real fear my luggage missed the connection. Nope, even with an air tag, I don't want to start my vacation without my luggage.\"\n",
        "    - BJ: \"@B.R.: Use a backpack for a personal item, adding a change of underwear and shirt/top. You'll be ready just in case. A friend also suggested using an airtag or tile packed in the suitcase in case it's lost.\"\n",
        "    - jk: \"@BJ: Yes, that holds you over for a day or so, but sometimes your luggage doesn't reach you for a week. Plus, you don't have anything nice to wear for the first couple of days. What if you're sightseeing and don't have the right outfit, walking shoes, or comfortable clothing?\"\n",
        "    - BJ: \"@jk: I always wear my walking shoes to fly. Airports are large, and they’re the bulkiest shoes I bring. Likewise, a foldable hat, medication, and toiletries should go in the personal item. Only once has my bag been misdirected in 60 years of flying.\"\n",
        "    - mdieri: \"@Bridgman: Noblesse oblige? It’s nice to fly unburdened, but you risk your luggage not arriving or arriving damaged. Last time I checked my rollaboard, I waited 45 minutes at baggage claim. Airlines should offer the first checked bag free, but they’re too greedy.\"\n",
        "    - Louise: \"@mdieri: Have you heard about Southwest Airlines? Two checked bags for free is standard policy. However, they’ve gone big on offering seating upgrades like Early Bird, which used to be cheaper. But for international travel, Southwest has limited routes.\"\n",
        "    - Winnie: \"@mdieri: I worry more about hurting my back from hefting a bag into the overhead than I do about bag damage or loss. Happy travels!\"\n",
        "    - Lc: \"@Bridgman: I'm the opposite. I never check a bag and can waltz off the plane and start my vacation without worrying about lost or delayed luggage. I have the right size bag, so I’m never desperately stuffing anything. I’ll never check a bag again!\"\n",
        "    - Mimi: \"@Bridgman: If you have connecting flights, it only takes one miss and lost luggage to change your mind!\"\n",
        "    - Kat: \"@B.R.: I'm with you! Friends had their luggage lost in Berlin, and it didn’t catch up with them for a week. That was a nightmare for them. Bridgman, count yourself lucky that your bag was waiting for you at your destination.\"\n",
        "    - Kat: \"@jk: Good points! I have no choice but to check a bag when doing summer mission work in Europe, but I make sure my carry-on can tide me over for a couple of days, including footwear. Friends lost their bags in Berlin for a whole week.\"\n",
        "    - Joel Lafleur: \"@Bridgman: I had to check a bag for the first time in 20 years because my wife's rollaboard wouldn’t fit in a tiny regional jet. We wasted 30 minutes at baggage claim and missed our connecting bus. Never again.\"\n",
        "    - Benita Auge: \"@Bridgman: For years, I took carry-ons onto the plane, but last year I started checking them. So far, the airline has lost it twice, and one was ripped open by handlers. I’m going back to keeping my carry-on with me.\"\n",
